*Things left to do:
	- George:
		-- Finish the fragments and hook them up to the button onClick handlers. 
		-- Make sure error handling for images/data is completed for cases where 
			the data for any given saved grid portion does not have an image or
			does not have any relevant data to display
		-- Remove the speed fragment xml file; I've already taken care of this.
	- Alex:
		-- Work more db stuff, still getting errors whenever using currently.
	- James & Me
		-- Once George and Alex are done, James and myself will finish cleaning
			things up and making sure edge cases are taken care of.
